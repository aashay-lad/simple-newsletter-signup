# simple-newsletter-signup

This is one of the project of a 15 Project Series made by Codesistency on Youtube. I'm currently learning by following along with this YouTube video, which covers a HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm taking notes, coding along, adding my own touch to it and documenting what I learn here in this repository. This is a work in progress as I continue watching and practicing each section.

This project is a simple newsletter signup application designed to collect user email addresses for subscription purposes. It features a straightforward interface and basic validation to ensure users enter valid email addresses before submitting their information.
